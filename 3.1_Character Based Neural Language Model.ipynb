    "- Next, we need to one hot encode each character. That is, each character becomes a vector as long as the vocabulary (38 elements) with a 1 marked for the specific character. This provides a more precise input representation for the network. It also provides a clear objective for the network to predict, where a probability distribution over characters can be output by the model and compared to the ideal case of all 0 values with a 1 for the actual next character. We can use the to categorical() function in the Keras API to one hot encode the input and output sequences."

    "- The model is defined with an input layer that takes sequences that have 10 time steps and 38 features for the one hot encoded input sequences. Rather than specify these numbers, we use the second and third dimensions on the X input data. This is so that if we change the length of the sequences or size of the vocabulary, we do not need to change the model definition. The model has a single LSTM hidden layer with 75 memory cells, chosen with a little trial and error. The model has a fully connected output layer that outputs one vector with a probability distribution across all characters in the vocabulary. A softmax activation function is used on the output layer to ensure the output has the properties of a probability distribution."
